# 👋 Hey, I'm Paschal Arowolo

I'm a DevOps and Automation Engineer in training — learning in public, building real projects, and growing one script at a time.

---

## 🚀 What I'm Focused On
- Web automation with Python & Selenium
- System monitoring and Linux scripting
- Git, GitHub, and CI fundamentals

---

## 🛠 Projects Coming Soon
I'm currently working on small, real-world automation tools as part of my 6-week DevOps GitHub streak.  
First project drops soon. Then the next. Then the next.

---

## 📌 Why I'm Doing This
I want to build discipline. I want to grow through real work.  
And I want everything I learn to be useful — not just theoretical.
